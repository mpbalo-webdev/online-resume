   <h1>Hobbies & Interests</h1>

    <p>I enjoy reading nonfiction books focused on self-development and psychology, particularly topics related to human behavior, mindset, and personal growth. Gardening herbs and spices is a relaxing hobby that helps me practice patience, consistency, and attention to detail. I also enjoy cooking, especially traditional Visayan dishes such as cansi, as well as simple desserts like mango float, which allows me to explore creativity and culture through food. </p>
    <p>Journaling is part of my routine for organizing thoughts, reflecting on life experiences, and maintaining mental clarity. In my downtime, I listen to personal development and leadership podcasts, including shows by Lewis Howes and Mel Robbins, to stay motivated and continuously improve my mindset and habits.</p>
